# CPU-Scheduling
This project is a CPU Scheduling Simulator built in Java using JavaFX. It supports algorithms like FCFS, SJF, Round Robin, and Priority Scheduling. Users can input processes, simulate scheduling, and view key metrics such as Completion Time, Waiting Time, and Turnaround Time. It's designed to help understand CPU scheduling algorithms.

Features:
1. FCFS, SJF, Round Robin, and Priority Scheduling algorithms.
2. Add processes with details like Arrival Time, Burst Time, and Priority.
3. Displays metrics such as Completion Time, Waiting Time, and Turnaround Time.

Requirements:
1. Java 8 or higher
2. JavaFX library for GUI

How to Run:
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Compile and run the Main.java file.
3. Use the UI to input processes and simulate CPU scheduling algorithms.
