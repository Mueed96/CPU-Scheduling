# CPU-Scheduling
This project is a CPU Scheduling Simulator built in Java using JavaFX. It supports algorithms like FCFS, SJF, Round Robin, and Priority Scheduling. Users can input processes, simulate scheduling, and view key metrics such as Completion Time, Waiting Time, and Turnaround Time. It's designed to help understand CPU scheduling algorithms.
